# Image Preprocessing for CNN Image Recognition

## Overview
This MATLAB script preprocesses image files for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image recognition system, preparing input images for further processing.

## Preprocessing Steps
- Reads bitmap (.bmp) image files
- Crops pixel values to 4-bit depth
- Converts image data to binary representation
- Writes processed image data to a text file for subsequent stages

## Key Features
- Supports 4-bit image representation
- Compatible with all image sizes
- Prepares images for CNN pattern recognition pipeline
