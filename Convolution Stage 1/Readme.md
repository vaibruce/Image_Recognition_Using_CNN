# Convolution Stage 1: Verification Module

## Overview
This folder contains **verification code and test benches** for the first stage of convolution using a Laplacian filter in our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image recognition system. 

**Important Note:** This is a standalone verification module for stage 1 of convolution and does not represent the complete image recognition implementation. Its primary purpose is to validate the correctness of the Laplacian filter convolution stage through comprehensive testing.

Key Verification Characteristics:
- Supports 128x128 and 256x256 pixel images
- Focuses on 4-bit image depth
- Validates Laplacian filter convolution implementation
- Verifies pipelined processing architecture's performance and accuracy
