# MaxPooling Stage: Verification Module

## Overview
This folder contains **verification code and test benches** for the MaxPooling stage in our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image recognition system.

**Important Note:** This is a standalone verification module for the MaxPooling stage and does not represent the complete image recognition implementation. Its primary purpose is to validate the correctness of the MaxPooling layer's functionality through comprehensive testing.

Key Verification Characteristics:
- Supports 128x128 and 256x256 pixel input feature maps
- Focuses on 4-bit image depth
- Validates spatial dimension reduction (by factor of 2)
- Verifies maximum value extraction mechanism
